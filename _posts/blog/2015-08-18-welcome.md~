A question anyone starting a blog in 2015 should answer:  

#####Why?

Like a lot of people, I think things through more throughly and with more discipline when writing them down. If I just consider a topic, I can tend to get into habits of thought. So the act of writing things out tends to give me clearer opinions on a topic.

#####Why not not keep a journal, then?

That's a good idea. But I don't challenge myself nearly as well as other people do. Having a blog where I write out my opinions puts me in a place where other people can bring their perspectives to bear. And I have a few ideas I'd like to put out there.
