Perhaps you have heard of the the sophisticated, elegant [Cloud-to-Butt plugin](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt), which searches through the text on a website for the phrase "The Cloud" and replaces it with "My Butt". [This compilation](http://gizmodo.com/the-best-of-cloud-to-butt-the-only-extension-youll-eve-1685863609) shows some of the most urbane results.

It struck me that if you replaced "Machine Learning Algorithm" with "Magic Spell" in many contexts, the content would feel very similar.

So I put together a Chrome plugin called "Machine Learning is Magic" that you can  [download here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/machine-learning-is-magic/miejfpgjbmgjkhdflhkdnnkhmpknibmc?hl=en)

becomes

And you get fun intro sites like this:

I ended up going a bit overboard and doing a few more replacements: "data" becomes "Raw Magic Material", "probability" becomes "The Fates", etc. I had fun with it.

 [The code](https://github.com/dswalter/machine-learning-is-magic) is a bit janky, so pull requests are welcome. And if you think I should make the simpler version that only replaces "machine learning algorithm" with "magic spells", leave a comment. Enjoy!
