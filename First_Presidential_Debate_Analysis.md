# Presidential Debate N-Grams.

I had a suspicion that a simple n-gram analysis, where we look at the co-occurring word sequences, would reveal some interesting insights into the presidential debates. so I grabbed a transcript off the internet and got to n-gramming.


```python
with open("/data/data/sentiment/debate_transcript.txt", "r") as f:
    all_lines = [line for line in f if line is not '\n']
```


```python
def tokenize_by_user(line_list, identifying_string):
    """Reads in lines, filters based on the identifying string, and returns a list of tokens."""
    speaker_lines = [line for line in line_list if identifying_string in line]
    speaker_text = "".join(speaker_lines)
    strings_to_drop = [identifying_string, "â€™"]
    for element in strings_to_drop:
        speaker_text = speaker_text.replace(element, "")
    speaker_text = speaker_text.lower()
    speaker_text = speaker_text.replace("\n", " NEWLINE ")
    tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'\w+')
    speaker_tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(speaker_text)
    return speaker_tokens

```


```python
trump_tokens = tokenize_by_user(all_lines, "Donald Trump:")
```


```python
clinton_tokens =  tokenize_by_user(all_lines, "Hillary Clinton:")
```


```python
trump_counter = Counter(trump_tokens)
print("Total number of words spoken by Trump: {}".format(len(trump_tokens)))
print("Number of unique words spoken by Trump: {}".format(len(trump_counter.keys())))
print("Ratio of unique words to total words: {}".format(len(trump_counter.keys())/len(trump_tokens)))
print("\n")
clinton_counter = Counter(clinton_tokens)
print("Total number of words spoken by Clinton: {}".format(len(clinton_tokens)))
print("Number of unique words spoken by Clinton: {}".format(len(clinton_counter.keys())))
print("Ratio of unique words to total words: {}".format(len(clinton_counter.keys())/len(clinton_tokens)))

```

    Total number of words spoken by Trump: 4153
    Number of unique words spoken by Trump: 827
    Ratio of unique words to total words: 0.19913315675415363
    
    
    Total number of words spoken by Clinton: 3099
    Number of unique words spoken by Clinton: 843
    Ratio of unique words to total words: 0.27202323330106487


Most of us at the debate probably realized that Mr. Trump spoke more than Secretary Clinton, but the disparity is sizeable, given the relatively tight structure of the debate. Mr. Trump likely speaks more quickly, but he may have also spoken for more time during the debate as well.


```python
pprint(trump_counter.most_common(20))
```

    [('i', 137),
     ('NEWLINE', 136),
     ('the', 135),
     ('to', 129),
     ('and', 122),
     ('you', 111),
     ('that', 78),
     ('of', 74),
     ('a', 73),
     ('have', 71),
     ('it', 63),
     ('in', 40),
     ('we', 39),
     ('was', 38),
     ('its', 36),
     ('but', 36),
     ('very', 35),
     ('are', 34),
     ('not', 32),
     ('is', 32)]



```python
pprint(clinton_counter.most_common(20))
```

    [('the', 119),
     ('and', 106),
     ('NEWLINE', 97),
     ('to', 90),
     ('i', 84),
     ('that', 73),
     ('a', 67),
     ('of', 62),
     ('you', 46),
     ('in', 44),
     ('we', 43),
     ('it', 38),
     ('well', 34),
     ('have', 34),
     ('is', 33),
     ('be', 33),
     ('for', 28),
     ('think', 28),
     ('not', 24),
     ('about', 24)]


As would be expected, these lists are mostly dominated by stop-words. Mr. Trump's most commonly spoken word , 'I', is Secretary Clinton's fourth most commonly spoken.


```python
trump_df = pd.DataFrame({'word':trump_tokens})
trump_df['wordlength']=trump_df['word'].apply(len)
clinton_df = pd.DataFrame({'word':clinton_tokens})
clinton_df['wordlength']=clinton_df['word'].apply(len)

trump_df['wordlength'].hist(bins=16, alpha=0.6, color='red')
plt.title("A histogram of Donald Trump's Word Lengths")

clinton_df['wordlength'].hist(bins=16, alpha=0.6, color='blue')
plt.title("A histogram of Word Lengths (colors are based on party lines)")
```

In general, Mr. Trump used shorter words than Secretary Clinton.

## The n-grams part

What we wanted to know was whether there were phrases that popped up frequently for each candidate, so we analyzed for n=2...10 whether there were repeated phrases. My implementation is naive, as it considers the entire spoken corpus of each candidate as one document.


```python
def find_ngrams(input_list, n):
    "A relatively elegant n-gram method I found on StackOverflow"
    return zip(*[input_list[i:] for i in range(n)])

def print_ngrams(input_tokens, n_grams, candidate_name):
    """Starts with tokens and ends with only the top 15 n-grams that have been repeated
    where available"""
    print("{}'s {}-grams".format(candidate_name, n_grams))
    found_ngrams = find_ngrams(input_tokens, n_grams)
    ngramcount = Counter(found_ngrams)
    repeat_keys = [key for key in ngramcount.keys() if ngramcount[key]>=2]
    relevant_entries = sorted([[key,ngramcount[key]] for key in repeat_keys], key = lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    pprint(relevant_entries[:15])
    print("\n")
```


```python
def print_ngrams(input_tokens, n_grams, candidate_name):
    """Starts with tokens and ends with only the top 15 n-grams that have been repeated
    where available"""
    print("{}'s {}-grams".format(candidate_name, n_grams))
    found_ngrams = find_ngrams(input_tokens, n_grams)
    ngramcount = Counter(found_ngrams)
    repeat_keys = [key for key in ngramcount.keys() if ngramcount[key]>=2]
    relevant_entries = sorted([[key, ngramcount[key]] for key in repeat_keys], key = lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print("{} {}-grams were repeated".format(len(relevant_entries),n_grams))
    for entry in relevant_entries[:15]:
        print("'{}' : {} times ".format(" ".join(entry[0]).replace("NEWLINE","-"), entry[1]))
    #pprint(relevant_entries[:15])
    print("\n")
    return len(relevant_entries)
```


```python
trump_repeats = {}
clinton_repeats = {}
```


```python
for n_gram in range(2,10):
    clinton_repeats[n_gram] = print_ngrams(clinton_tokens, n_gram, 'Hillary Clinton')

### A few phrases seem notably rehearsed: 

    'taxes on the wealthy' : 3 times 

    'million people lost their' [jobs] : 2 times  
 
    'would add 5 trillion to the debt' : 2 times 


### Then there is the repeated phrase: 

    'there are different - there are different' : 2 times, 

which may have come during an interruption. It's interesting to note that there are no 8 or 9-grams.


```python
for n_gram in range(2,10):
    trump_repeats[n_gram] = print_ngrams(trump_tokens, n_gram, 'Donald Trump')

    'thats the kind of thinking that our country needs' : 2 times 

  
 
Mr. Trump had two repeated 9-grams, which are pretty sizable pieces of text. I also thought it would be worth looking at the total number of n-grams for each speaker. 



```python
trump_repeat = pd.Series(trump_repeats)
trump_repeat = trump_repeat/(len(trump_tokens)/len(clinton_tokens))
trump_repeat.plot(kind='bar', color='red', alpha=0.7, title='Number of repeated n-grams for Donald Trump')
plt.ylim(0,500)
plt.show()

clinton_repeat = pd.Series(clinton_repeats)
clinton_repeat.plot(kind='bar', color='blue', alpha=0.7, title='Number of repeated n-grams for Hillary Clinton')
plt.ylim(0,500)
plt.show()
```

![png](output_21_1.png)


For the images above, I accounted for the difference in total words spoken between the two by scaling Mr. Trump's counts by the same factor his total tokens outnumbered Secretary Clinton's. It is immmediately clear that Mr. Trump had more repeated phrase chunks of every size.

# Conclusions?

From this cursory n-gram-based method of analysis, it appears that Mr. Trump had more repeated phrases, even relatively longer phrases, than Secretary Clinton. One explanation could be that Mr. Trump's debate preparation may have emphasizeds word-for-word talking points more than Secretary Clinton's.
